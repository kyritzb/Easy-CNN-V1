# Easy-CNN-V1
Computer Vision Tools

## What does this application do?
This app was made by Bryan Kyritz in order to make the implication of Convolution neural network(CNN) easy. This app can only detect if a single object is present in an image or video and will return true or false if the object is in frame. The tool is used to generate the weights for the object which can be used by the user to implement into another project.

## Built using:

1. Tensorflow CPU
2. Tkinter


## Features of the program
    
### Dataset development:

1. Download images from online for training data
2. Parse frames from video for training data
3. Auto delete pictures ( every other )
    
### Model Development:

1. Train a model
2. Test a model using webcam or pre-downloaded video
    
### Additional Features:

1. Export code in textfile to be used by others
2. Generate video or image with detection
